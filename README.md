Voice Assistant

This is a simple voice assistant built using Python. It uses libraries such as `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pywhatkit`, `wikipedia`, and `pyjokes` to recognize voice commands and perform tasks like playing songs, fetching information from Wikipedia, telling jokes, and more.

Features

Play Music: The assistant can play songs from YouTube by recognizing commands like "play [song name]".
Tells Time: The assistant can tell the current time when asked.
Wikipedia Search: It can search and provide information from Wikipedia about a person or topic.
Tell Jokes: The assistant can tell random jokes using the `pyjokes` library.
Basic Conversation: It responds to simple questions such as "Are you single?" or "What is the date?".
